The story begins with who's gonna win
Knowing the danger that lies within
Aboard the ARK, a genius at heart
Wanting to unlock the mysteries of life

I am the Eggman, that's what I am
I am the Eggman, I got the master plan.
I am the Eggman, that's what I am,
I am the Eggman, I got the master plan.

I'm plotting my schemes,
Wherever I go,
They're perfect in every way.
I'd love to destroy,
The blue one you know,
He's an obstacle who always gets in my way.

I must play this game by my rules
I will conquer the world with my tools
All my machines are made for destruction
I will build my empire
I will succeed and you will see
With my machines, there is no retreat

I am the Eggman, that's what I am
I am the Eggman, I got the master plan.
I am the Eggman, that's what I am,
I am the Eggman, I got the master plan.

I am the enemy, I will succeed
My mission, yeah, I must complete
My name is Eggman, don't forget my name
If you ask me again I'll tell you the same

I am the Eggman, that's what I am
I am the Eggman, I got the master plan.
I am the Eggman, that's what I am,
I am the Eggman, I got the master plan.

I am the Eggman
